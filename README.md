# Path Finding Visualiser
A website that can visualise path finding and maze generation algorithms.

## [Demo (Drawing and moving only available on desktops)](https://0mn1verze.github.io/path-finding-visualiser/)
- Drag to move the start point and draw walls, drag on wall to remove it

## Path Finding Algorithms
- A*
- BFS
- DFS
- Dijkstra
- Bidirectional A* (Starts at start node and end node at the same time)
- Bidirectional BFS
- Bidirectional Dijkstra

## Maze Generation Algorithms
- Simple random maze
- Recursive division maze
- Backtracking/DFS maze
- Kruskal's Algorithm
- Eller's Algorithm
- Prim's Algorithm
